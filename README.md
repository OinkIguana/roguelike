# roguelike (working title)

Classic ASCII art terminal game.

Both versions are very much "in progress", and probably will always be that way.

The C++ version was based on a school project I did, hoping to fix some of the
things that could have been done better in the end. I think this version will be
abandoned, but it is pretty cool so far I guess.

The Rust version is just for me to learn Rust, but if I ever finish this project
I will likely finish it in the Rust version.
